    <p>It's (almost) March 14 and time to celebrate that mysterious and wonderful mathematical relationship between a circle's radius and its circumference:   = 3.1415926535...</p>
<p>Aside from eating circular food, proving the existence of pi by measuring the radius (or diameter) and circumference of a circle, solving problems about circles or reciting as many digits of Pi as you can remember, how can you celebrate?</p>

<h3>Write a PI-KU!<h3>

<p>A "pi-ku” works like this:</p>

<p>First line: 3 syllables</p>

<p>Second line: 1 syllable</p>

<p>Third line: 4 syllables</p>

<p>Fourth line: 1 syllable</p>

<p>Fifth line:  5 syllables</p>

<p>N: (ad infinitum)</p>

<h3>Many people stop after the third line, which yields a haiku-like short poem like this one:</h3>

 
Beautiful  <br>
And <br>
Circular, pi <br>

<h3> Or at the fourth line: </h3>

Radius <br>
And <br>
Circumference <br>
Pi <br>

<p> 
What about the subject of your Pi-ku? Think about the look and feel of a circle – never-ending, round, no starting or ending point.  
Think about circular items:  clocks, wheels, rings.
Think about words associated with circles: round, sphere, vortex, revolve, hoop, halo, disk, oscillate, orbit.  Or just write about Spring! </p>

<p>
Spring Pi-ku:
<br>
<br>3            Leaves whisper </br>
<br>1            wind </br>
<br>4            breathes so softly </br>
<br>1            sky </br>
<br>5            celestial blue </br>
<br>9            small cumulus puffs drift above me </br>
<br>2            tulips </br>
<br>6            yellow, pink, purple, white </br>
<br>5            new sprung grass so green </br>
<br>3            I love spring! </br>
