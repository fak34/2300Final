      <h1>Have fun with Girls' Math Circle</h1>
      <p><img src= "images/pi_day_2015.jpg" class="image"><p>
      <p>The Ithaca Girls' Math Circle is a group of girls in Grades 6-11 who meet every Saturday 5:00-7:15 p.m. in Corson Hall. Dinner is included as part of the meeting. The focus of the group is to stimulate interest in mathematics as well as to prepare the girls for math competitions. If you are a girl in grades 6-11 who loves mathematics, or if you are an undergraduate or graduate student interested in becoming a mentor to this group, please contact Dr. Laura Jones (lej4@cornell.edu).
